function F = friction(rob,in2)
%% FRICTION - Joint friction for the Puma 560 copy arm. 
% ========================================================================= 
%    
%    F = friction(rob,qd) 
%    F = rob.friction(qd) 
%    
%  Description:: 
%    Given a full set of generalized joint velocities the function 
%    computes the friction forces/torques. 
%    
%  Input:: 
%    rob: robot object of Puma 560 copy specific class 
%    qd:  6-element vector of generalized 
%         velocities 
%    Angles have to be given in radians! 
%    
%  Output:: 
%    F:  [6x1] vector of joint friction forces/torques

%% Bugfix
%  In some versions the symbolic toolbox writes the constant $pi$ in
%  capital letters. This way autogenerated functions might not work properly.
%  To fix this issue a local variable is introduced:
PI = pi;
