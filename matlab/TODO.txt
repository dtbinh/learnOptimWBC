general
instead of using RNE maybe is better to precompute the dynamics term using the symbolic routines inside the toolboox


Subchains
implement a way to manage the case of blocked joints for visualization and simulation of subchain task

UF
implement mask fuctionalities
add other trajectories
sampling trajectories 
tracking orientation task
joint task (maybe)
regulation for orientation and positon task
force task
projection chaining of the task



build class alpha function

add alpha to UF

build class instance for learning (cmaes)

implement GHC




update Subchains (better managment of jacobian)
