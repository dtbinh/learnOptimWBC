some hypothesis:


1) i consider constraints that have this structure:

g(x)<0
h(x) = 0

if h(x)!=0 i have to take the absolute value of the violations (to compute like that inside the constraints function itself)

2) in the execution of a robotic experiment i consider only the sum of violation over a rollout. if there is no violation i sum up all the negative one
