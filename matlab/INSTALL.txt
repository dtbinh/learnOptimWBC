Follow the instructions to install the optWBI toolbox.

1) download from http://petercorke.com/Robotics_Toolbox.html the robotics toolbox v 9.10
   and install it on matlab 

2) run startup.m in the matlab folder of the toolbox

3) compile the mex file for the newton eulero dynamic computation in the robotic toolbox   (rvctools_folder/robot/mex). then copy the resulting file in rvctools_folder/robot/@SerialLink

4) run the script MainRobotGen.m in optWBI/matlab/Robot to create a symbolic model (dynamic and kinematic or only kinematic) of the robot described in the file Mdl***.m.
The Mdl***.m files contain a D-H description of the robot plus dynamic information. the syntax used is the same of the robotics toolbox (read there for more details)
