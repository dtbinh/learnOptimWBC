function fkine = fkine(rob,in2)
%% FKINE - Forward kinematics solution including tool transformation for the Puma 560 copy arm. 
% ========================================================================= 
%    
%    T = fkine(rob,q) 
%    T = rob.fkine(q) 
%    
%  Description:: 
%    Given a full set of joint variables the function 
%    computes the pose belonging to that joint with respect to the base frame. 
%    
%  Input:: 
%    rob: robot object of Puma 560 copy specific class 
%    q:  6-element vector of generalized 
%         coordinates 
%    Angles have to be given in radians! 
%    
%  Output:: 
%    T:  [4x4] Homogenous transformation matrix relating the pose of the tool 
%              for the given joint values to the base frame.

%% Bugfix
%  In some versions the symbolic toolbox writes the constant $pi$ in
%  capital letters. This way autogenerated functions might not work properly.
%  To fix this issue a local variable is introduced:
PI = pi;
